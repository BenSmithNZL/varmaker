\description{
Simulate observations from the canonical VMA of order Q and dimension K.
}
\details{
This function simulates observations from the canonical VAM model of order Q and dimension K. The model is given by:
\deqn{z_t = \theta_0 + \theta_1 a_{t-1} + \ldots + \theta_Q a_{t-Q} + a_t}
where \eqn{z_t} is a K-length vector, \eqn{\theta_0} is a K-length intercept vector, \eqn{\theta_h} is a K-by-K coefficient matrix, \eqn{a_t} is a K-length vector of innovations, and \eqn{a_t \sim N(0, \Sigma_a)}.

The first element of \code{theta} corresponds to
\eqn{\theta_0} and must be a K-length vector. All following elements must be K-by-K matrices, with the second element corresponding to
\eqn{\theta_1}, the third to \eqn{\theta_2}, and so on. Only \eqn{\theta_0} is required; all further coefficient matrices are optional.
\code{Sigma_a} must be symmetrical or else an error will be thrown.

A certain number of burn-ins observations are used when simulation. These observations are discarded once the observations are generated.
